# Model Engine
Model Engine is a Minecraft plugin that breaks the barrier of entity modeling and allows you to create mod-like models, animate them, and give complete control to its animation. You may have heard of a plugin named ModelAPI, a modeling plugin that requires you to have basic knowledge of java and coding plugins. Model Engine, however, completely removed the need for coding anything. In other words, you are free to create anything, without knowing java!

## Supported Version
Currently, Model Engine supports Minecraft 1.14 to 1.16. If you want 1.13 or below, check out [ModelAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/modelapi-custom-entity-model-manager.68014/).

## Installation
1. Download Model Engine
2. Place the plugin jar file into the `plugins` folder of your server
3. Happy modeling
